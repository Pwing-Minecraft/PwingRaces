Reporting Issues:
---------
Sometimes people report bugs or problems that lack sufficient information.


The problem is that if you don't give us enough information to 
replicate bugs and we cannot identify exactly under what conditions 
a bug is present, then it becomes harder to fix. 


Please, if you report a bug, provide ample information about your situation. 


If you need an answer in a timely manner, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jn2GAjz).

We really appreciate when you report bugs, and we would like you to report them to us whenever you find them.
However please be mindful of the information that you give us and/or how you contact us. If you really have no 
idea where to start, maybe a 1 on 1 conversation on Discord may be the way to go. If you know exactly how to replicate your problem, or 
you have a good amount of information about it, creating a new issue might be a better solution:

Why is this repository here?
---------
This repository serves as a place for people to report bugs or give suggestions to the plugin without having to have a Discord account. 
We understand that while most everyone involved in the plugin community has a Discord account, not everyone does. So we created this
GitHub page as a place where you can still communicate with the developers without having to use Discord.

Still unsure about something or need further assistance?
---------
Please feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jn2GAjz). If you do not have Discord, please feel free to write
a message in the Discussion section on Spigot.
